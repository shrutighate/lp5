/*
This C++ code is a parallel implementation of the Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) 
algorithms for traversing or searching graph data structures. It uses OpenMP, a library for parallel programming 
in C++, to parallelize the algorithms.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

The Graph class represents a graph using an adjacency list. It has a constructor that initializes the number of vertices (V) 
and the adjacency list (adj), and a method addEdge to add an edge between two vertices.

The parallelDFSUtil method is a helper function for the parallel DFS algorithm. It marks a vertex as visited and then 
recursively visits all its unvisited neighbors. The loop that iterates over the neighbors is parallelized using 
the #pragma omp parallel for directive.

The parallelDFS method initializes a vector of atomic booleans to keep track of the visited vertices and then 
calls parallelDFSUtil on the start vertex. The use of std::atomic<bool> ensures that updates to the visited 
vector are thread-safe

The parallelBFS method implements the parallel BFS algorithm. It uses a queue to keep track of vertices to visit
 and a vector of booleans to keep track of visited vertices. The loop that iterates over the neighbors of a vertex 
 is parallelized using the #pragma omp parallel for directive.


 The main function creates a Graph object, adds edges to it to form a specific graph, and then calls parallelDFS 
 and parallelBFS to perform DFS and BFS on the graph, starting from vertex 0.


The libraries used in this code are:

<iostream>: This is a standard C++ library for input/output operations. It's used here to print the order of 
vertices visited by the DFS and BFS algorithms 

<atomic>: This is a C++ library that provides components for fine-grained atomic operations,
 allowing for lock-free concurrent programming. It's used here to ensure that updates to the visited vector 
 in the parallel DFS algorithm are thread-safe.


<vector>: This is a standard C++ library that provides a dynamic array. It's used here to implement the adjacency
 list and the visited vector.

<queue>: This is a standard C++ library that provides a queue data structure. It's used here in the BFS algorithm 
to keep track of vertices to visit.

<omp.h>: This is the header file for OpenMP, a library for parallel programming in C++. It's used here to parallelize
the DFS and BFS algorithms
